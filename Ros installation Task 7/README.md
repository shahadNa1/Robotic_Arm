# Ros installation-and-configuration

In this project we want to create a robot arm, and to start we need to create a simulation of the robot arm using AKA “ROS” robot operating system.

ROS can be installed on Ubuntu using Virtual Box or it can be found online using https://www.theconstructsim.com/, 
I chose to work with the online tool because working with ubuntu requires a lot of computer space.
 However, I preferred to use the online tool.
