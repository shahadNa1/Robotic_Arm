# Ros installation and configuration

In this project, we want to create a robot arm, and to start we need to create a simulation of the robot arm using a robot operating system AKA “ROS”.

ROS can be either be installed on Ubuntu using Virtual Box or it can be found online using https://www.theconstructsim.com/, I chose to work with the online tool as working with ubuntu requires a lot of the PC space. However, 
by using the online tool to control a robot arm actuator using Robot Operating System (ROS) platform with Rviz, Gazebo and Moveit Simulator.
