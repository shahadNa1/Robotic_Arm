(index.php) this file contain the HTML part for the front-end and the PHP part of handling "Save" button, why we merege HTML & PHP here? because; we don't want the click on "Save" button redirect to another page, and this one of the solutions. We also created stylesheet called (style.css) to make the interface look nice :) .. We use JavaScript in (sc.js) file to help in display the slider value and to link "On" button with PHP handeler (handel_On.php), and this handeler also update the value of the power switcher from 0 to 1 in the database when we click "On" button. finally the (arm.sql) file is conatin the database table we created with 7 columns: auto-increment id, 5 motors, and power switcher. thier data type is Integer.
