# robotic-arm and end-effector

The robotic arm was installed through a 3D design program. Of course, I used some references to be able to design the robotic arm:

1- I downloaded the files for the arm

2- Download the builder 3d program

3- I uploaded all the files to the program, and started installing the hand. 

4- End Effector.
